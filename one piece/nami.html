        "Cat Burglar" Nami[11] is the navigator of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat
        Grand Fleet.[4] She is the third member of the crew and the second to join, doing so during the Orange Town
        Arc.[19] She is the adoptive sister of Nojiko after the two were orphaned and taken in by Bell-m√®re.

        She was formerly a member of the Arlong Pirates and initially joined the Straw Hats so that she could rob them
        in order to buy back her village from Arlong. However, she legitimately joined the Straw Hats after they
        rebelled against and defeated Arlong. Her dream is to make a map of the entire world.[20]

        She first gained a bounty of Beli16,000,000 following the raid on Enies Lobby. It later increased to
        Beli66,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, her bounty was increased to
        Beli366,000,000.[4]
